### Drug Detection System in Java

>This project, titled Drug Detection System (DDS), serves as an innovative solution for detecting drug abuse through the analysis of pupil dilation. Initially developed in Python, this Java implementation enhances performance and usability, leveraging Java's robust features for graphical user interfaces and real-time processing.

**Why Java?**

Transitioning from Python to Java allows for several advantages:

**Performance:**
Java’s compiled nature often results in faster execution times, which is crucial for real-time video processing.

**Strong Typing:** 
Java’s strict type system reduces the likelihood of runtime errors, enhancing the overall reliability of the application.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:** 
Utilizing Java enables the application to run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), increasing accessibility.

**Rich GUI Frameworks:**
Java provides extensive libraries for creating sophisticated user interfaces, such as Swing, making it easier to develop a visually appealing and user-friendly application.

**Features**
1. Real-Time Pupil Dilation Detection: Uses OpenCV for image processing to assess pupil size and detect potential drug influence.
2. Data Storage: Patient details are stored in a MySQL database, facilitating easy access and management of patient information.
3. Graphical Representation: The application visualizes dilation data using JFreeChart, allowing for straightforward analysis of results.
4. User-Friendly Interface: A dark mode GUI enhances the user experience, providing a modern look and feel.
5. Future Enhancements
While this project offers essential functionalities, there are opportunities for further improvements, including advanced machine learning models for more accurate detection and a mobile version for wider accessibility.
